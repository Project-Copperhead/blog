          <p className="text-xl">
            This site leverages a few cool techniques to appear as one, cohesive
            application. However, this landing page at the base route of the
            domain is one app and the about me route is another app. I'm using
            two create-react-apps with the GH-pages deploy system and github
            hosting. The goal of this strategy is to utilize the free nature of
            Github to host my own portfolio applications. This way, I don't have
            additional payment overhead unlike if I were to go with another
            deploy strategy utilizing netlify or vercel. I could expand this
            further and power a data fetching system. One can store open JSON
            files on github, and use fetch to get that data then render it on
            the page.

            One of my favorite things about programming is the democratization
            of knowledge and abilities. I think this website is an example of
            how one can take advantage of the open source nature of these
            excellent tools. It also demonstrates that one may not need to focus
            on the most flashy or latest fad to produce value.
